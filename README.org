* Contributing to neon-os

Any community contributions to the neon-os script is welcomed. Please
consider the section below before contributing.

** Test your changes before pushing

It would be a good idea to keep a clean installation of an Arch-based
distro in a virtual machine, and then clone that clean VM when you need
to test the script. Please don't do a merge request without attempting
to run the script in a fresh VM (one that you haven't previously ran the
script on).

* advice or suggestions

for any advice or suggestion email us on: 1)
