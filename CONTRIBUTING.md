# Things to consider before contributing.

## Test your changes before pushing

It would be a good idea to keep a clean installation of an Arch-based
distro in a virtual machine, and then clone that clean VM when you need
to test the script. Please don\'t do a merge request without attempting
to run the script in a fresh VM (one that you haven\'t previously ran
the script on).

## Knowledge required

-   Bash basics.
-   Linux command line utils should be known.

## guidlines

-   please be patient

-   treat everyone with respect --- (\"give respect and take respect\")

-   document your code properly

-   provide a brief description of what changes you made in the pull
    request

-   provide an apropriate header to pull requests

    **NOTE:** The test directory is where the contributions should go.
    In simple terms, it is the working directory for this project.
