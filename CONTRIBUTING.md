# Things to consider before contributing.

## Test your changes before pushing

It would be a good idea to keep a clean installation of an Arch-based distro in a virtual machine, and then clone that clean VM when you need to test the script. Please don\'t do a merge request without attempting to run the script in a fresh VM (one that you haven\'t previously ran the script on).

## Knowledge required

- Bash basics.
- Linux command line utils should be known.

## guidlines

- Please be patient.
- Treat everyone with respect -- \"give respect and take respect.\"
- Document your code properly with Rust coding conventions in mind.
- Provide a brief description of the changes you made in the pull request.
- Provide an appropriate header for the pull request.


**NOTE:** The rolling branch is where all contributions should go. In simple terms, it is the working branch for this project.
